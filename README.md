# C5.4 Networks, University of Oxford

In this repository, we display the [report](https://github.com/thomasarmstrong98/hypergraph_project/blob/master/networks_1041671_final.pdf), and code submitted for the assessment of the C5.4 Networks module. Task was to take the theory of network science and apply it to hypergraphs. In my report, I look at node centrality measures using random walks on hypergraphs, and ultimately construct a biased random-walk centrality measure in a similar fashion to PageRank.
